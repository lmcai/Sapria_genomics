Evidence-based MAKER run1
------------
The initial MAKER run was based on EST data from four Rafflesiaceae species including Sapria, proteoms from close relatives (Manihot, Populus and Vitis), and swissprot-uniprot database. We especially set "split_hit=100000" to accomodate the long intron in Sapria.
