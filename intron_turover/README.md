# Intron turnover in Sapria
The intron length in Sapria exhibits extreme disparity, containing both highly streamlined genes and genes with the longest introns reported in angiosperms.

## Characterization of intron position and length
We used a custom python script `summarize_gene_len_intron_size_from_gff.py` to summarize the gene length, intron number, intron length, and CDS length for each gene. 
```
python summarize_gene_len_intron_size_from_gff.py [input_genome_annotation.gff] [output_file.csv]
```
